        - If the target user accepts, draw the boards
    GAME_PLACE (server <- & -> client):
        - Lets the server tell the user to place their ships (and draws their board)
        - Lets the user return where to place their ships on the starting baord (only can move ships before the first round)
    GAME_STATE (server -> client):
        - Opponent Board
        - Player Board
        - Game message (whether there was a hit, miss, etc.)
    GAME_TURN (client -> server):
        - Lets the user taget a location to fire a shot (or multiple for salvo)
    GAME_END (server -> client):
        - Who won (message)
        - Remove users from game & remove spectaters
        - Kill game thread

TODO:
- only sends a message when using /name -- when using /rename it doesnt, and only works if connected to a server
- It creates the battleship thread, but then nothing happens
